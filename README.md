# Weather-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing one year of daily weather data (2024) for five major Indian cities – Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, and Kolkata. The dataset includes key meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, air pressure, visibility, and overall weather conditions.

# Objectives

Analyze temperature trends (max & min) by city and month.

Track rainfall distribution and identify the wettest city.

Study the relationship between humidity, rainfall, wind speed, and pressure.

Categorize weather conditions (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, Stormy).

Identify extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rain, and storms.

# Tools Used  
**Python**  – Data cleaning, analysis, visualization  
**Excel** – Quick data exploration  
**Power BI** – Interactive dashboard
